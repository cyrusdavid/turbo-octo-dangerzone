When you play videos on [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html‎){:rel='nofollow'} you may notice the video looks washed out compared to other players. Here's how to fix it!




1. Go to `Start` » `Control Panel` » `Appearance and Personalization` » `nVidia Control Panel` or double-click on the nvidia logo at your system tray.

2. Under `Video` » `Adjust Video Color Settings` » `Advanced` tab, select the *Dynamic Range* to **Full 0-255**.

3. Hit `Apply` and see the changes!

Better, right?
